| 1 | Introduction |
+---+--------------+

C-Dogs SDL is a port of a really fun old DOS game to modern operating systems,
using the SDL media libraries for graphics, sound and input (hence the name).

For more information about the original c-dogs read 'original_readme.txt'.

| 2 | Tested Environments |
+---+---------------------+

C-Dogs SDL has been ported with a unix development environment. In theory, C-Dogs SDL
could run on any system that is supported by SDL. See the SDL website - www.libsdl.org
for more details on SDL itself.

C-Dogs was primarily developed on these two systems:

Jeremy's System:
	Procesor:		Pentium 4 2.0ghz
	OS:			Gentoo Linux
	Kernel:			Linux kernel 2.6
	Compiler:		gcc 3.3
	Misc:			libSDL 1.2.x,
				XFree86 4.3,
				glibc 2.3.2

Lucas's System:
	Processor:		Pentium II 400mhz
	OS:			Gentoo Linux
	Kernel:			Linux kernel 2.6
	Compiler:		gcc 3.3, gcc 3.4
	Misc:			libSDL 1.2.x,
				XFree86 4.3, Xorg 6.8
				glibc 2.3

it was also tested on:

Pentium 166mhz
96mb RAM
Slackware Linux 9.1
Linux kernel 2.4.22

To compile C-Dogs you need to have the SDL libraries previously installed,
a compiler (gcc recommended) and the apropriate header files. These instructions
assume you have the know-how to at least compile something... :)

Step 0: 
	change into the source directory
	$ cd src
	
Step 1:
	Edit the Makefile
	(change the CFLAGS variable so something desirable, as well as
	the PREFIX for installation and any other variables that you're
	confident in messing with)

Step 2:
	(at the command line)
	$ make

	It is suggested that you shut your eyes, so as to block out your
	compiler's warnings... ;)

Step 3:
	(if make worked)
	$ make install

	You probably need to change to root/super user (you weren't running as
	root, where you!?!) before you type the above command.

| 4 | Command line options |
+---+----------------------+

The C-Dogs binary is called "cdogs", below are some command line arguments:

	-fullscreen	C-Dogs will try and become full screen (recommended)
	
	-wait		C-Dogs will wait for a key to be hit before 
			initialising graphics
	
	-nosound	C-Dogs won't play sounds, thus saving CPU usage and
			leaving your sound-card alone (if you have one)

These can be used in any order/combination:
	$ cdogs -fullscreen -wait
Which will make it go full screen after all the pre-video stuff is displayed
on stdout.
