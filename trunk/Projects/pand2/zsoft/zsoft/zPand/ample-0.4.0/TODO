AMPLE TODO list:

* Playlists
	I didn't think of it first but if Ample could give you a playlist the
	client can mix together his/her own mix like they want it. 
	This would be in .m3u-format. High prio ;-)

* Signal-controllable:
	To allow you to skip tracks etc by sending the right signal to 
	Ample from a shell.

* Custom song titles
	Like XMMS can be configured what to show
	
* HTML files should show dirs as well as files
	Right now Ample only displays files, this needs some
	reworking of the dirscan code though.

* Some more advanced HTTP request stuff
	Work has started, "Content-Length" now works,
	but "Range" would be nice to have as well.
	See http://bugs.xmms.org/show_bug.cgi?id=311 for inspiration

* HTTP Authentication (base64.[ch] is one step towards this)
	To allow password protection so that clients
	would have to connect with
	http://username:password@servername:port/
	
* Plugins for XMMS/WinAmp
	For instance:
	To make them send status of the "Random" button.
	To make skip forward and skip backward actually work.

* Many clients, same stream
	Has been requested by some people, probably far into the future though

* Recoding files to common bitrate "on the fly"
	Shouldn't be too hard (popen()) but some hairy details to 
	figure out first
