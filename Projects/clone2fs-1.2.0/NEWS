Changes in clone2fs 1.2.0:

	* Changed license to GPL.

Changes in clone2fs 1.1.0:

	* `clone2fs -s' writes a compact image; `clone2fs -r' restores it.
	  `clone2fs -r' will read from standard input if you specify `-'
	  as the source. Thus, you can clone a volume across the network
	  with e.g.

	  	clone2fs -o - -q -s /dev/source | \
	  		ssh target clone2fs -O /dev/destination -r -

	  Note the use of `-q' to quieten the first invocation. Of
	  course you could also hush the second one, or both.

	  Use of ssh's built-in compression is NOT recommended. Even
	  `gzip -1' slows down the transfer considerably. If your
	  network is too slow to go without compression, consider
	  Markus Oberhumer's `lzop' (www.lzop.org).

	* With the `-I' option, clone2fs will ignore read errors. This
	  may be useful if your disk contains bad sectors (besides those
	  already in the bad blocks list).

	* If the source volume is mounted and writable, clone2fs will
	  now warn you that the resulting image may be inconsistent.

	* When the destination volume is mounted (writable or not),
	  clone2fs will refuse to continue.
