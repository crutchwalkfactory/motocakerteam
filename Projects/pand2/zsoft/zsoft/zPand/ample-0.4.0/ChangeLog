AMPLE ChangeLog:

2001-12-16 03:07 - David Härdeman <david@2gen.com> - Version 0.4.0

	* Yes, I bumped the number to 0.4.0
	  (that's because I plan to do like many other projects and have a 
	   devel version that has an odd minor version and a stable version
	   with an even minor version)
	* Make ID3v2 code understand versions 2.2.0 -> 2.4.0 
	  (all currently existing versions)
	* Reformat HTML output somewhat
	* Fix search-and-replace error in libwrap code
	* Made servername a config option
	* Renamed -r to -n (NON-recursive)
	* Changed the DEF_LOGFILE 
	  (it pointed to ample.conf instead of ample.log)
	* Much work on autoconf stuff, should work much better now
	* Some more testing on other architectures
	  (I've compiled it on everything from Tru64 to Linux to *BSD)
	
2001-12-08 20:54 - David Härdeman <david@2gen.com> - Version 0.3.0pre1

	* Tested (and verified) with mpg123, XMMS, Windows Media Player 
	  and WinAmp
	  (which included resolving a bug with song titles which some 
	   people have reported)
	* This is hopefully the last test release prior to 0.3.0
	* Change generated HTML so that it links to the files
	* Added -r/--norecursive option to avoid the recursive search 
	  for MP3 files
	* Some fixes which should help Windows Media Player and MPG123
	* Fixed so that it supports "single mode" where a specific MP3 
	  file is requested
	  (instead of an entire dir of MP3's)
	* Add autoconf checks for socklen_t
	  (which should check for socklen_t == size_t as well but I'm too lazy)
	* Makes dirscan code use mp3entry directly in it's sorting array 
	  (should give a small performance boost in indexing large MP3 dirs)
	* Remove all fopen/fclose madness, everything is trough streams now
	* Added "Content-Length" header in single MP3 mode
	  (so that WinAmp and Media Player can give "progress bars")
	
2001-11-26 22:33 - David Härdeman <david@2gen.com> - Version 0.2.9
	
	* This will be a test release due to the amount of new features
	* In total these changes should close almost all TODO items
	  (except the last three items)
	* rearranged some files
	* made ample less "chatty"
	* speeded up all the ID3vx parsing code
	* added ID3v2 parsing support
	* removed buggy ID3v2 tagging support (now "pure" ShoutCast mode)
	* inetd support, "automatically" selects daemon or non daemon mode
	* Some basic config file support, see ample.conf.example for ideas
	* Made debug level a config option
	* Ample now daemonizes itself
	* Ample now logs via syslog 
	  (or /var/log/ample if no syslog headers are found)
	* Fixed an error which broke index.html support
	* Added libwrap (tcpd) support
	  (./configure --with-libwrap to use)
	* Made number of clients a run-time option
	  (ample -c NUMBER)

2001-11-12 17:05 - David Härdeman <david@2gen.com> - Version 0.2.1

	* Lots of work on reading/understanding ID3v1/ID3v2 tags 
	  (ID3v2 currently incomplete)
	* Support sending song titles 
	  (using either ID3v2 or ShoutCast metadata)
	* Lots of cleanups
	* Compiles with -Wall -pedantic without warnings
	* Strips "not wanted" ID3vX tags 
	  (which could case unsync and skipping in the sound)
	
2001-10-02 22:44 - David Härdeman <david@2gen.com> - Version 0.2.0

	* make install target
	* Some index.html capabilities
	  (try connecting to http://server:port/index.html)
	* Security fix (doesn't care about ../ in paths)

2001-08-09 08:59 - David Härdeman <david@2gen.com> - Version 0.1.1

	* Compile fix for Alpha
	* Add this, and some other, docs


2001-08-07 07:14 - David Härdeman <david@2gen.com> - Version 0.1.0

	* implemented fork, which means > 1 client supported 
	  (if you change the #define at the start of ample.c) 
	* implemented sorting of files, start with -o to have them sorted 
	* code cleanups


2001-07-30 14:45 - David Härdeman <david@2gen.com> - Version 0.0.2

	* Start using autoconf
	* Portability fixes/cleanups

	
2001-07-30 00:00 - David Härdeman <david@2gen.com> - Version 0.0.1

	* Just the most basic functionality
	* Select a directory at startup
	* Only one client
	* The connected client would get all files randomized
