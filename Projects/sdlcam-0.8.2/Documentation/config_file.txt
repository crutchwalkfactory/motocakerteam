Hi,
this is the description what values can be found in the Config File
and what they do. Also the syntax of the config file is described.
That mean you not longer need to look in the source to find what can be
configured. 



Syntax:

<LINE>       ::= <ASSIGNMENT>?<SPACE>+<COMMENT>
<ASSIGNMENT> ::= <KEY><SPACE>=<SPACE><VALUE>
<KEY>        ::= (!isspace())+
<SPACE>      ::= (isspace())*
<COMMENT     ::=  [^\n\r]*
<VALUE>      ::= <NONWHITE>|<ESC_STRING>
<NONWHITE>   ::= (!isspace())+



the recognized <KEY> values are:

DUMP_PATH	= "This value tell the program on witch patch the captured picture shpould be stored"
DUMP_MODE	= "0-2 Tells what target image format shall be used (jpeg,png,bmp)"
DUMP_QUALITY	= "The quality of compressed jpeg's"
DUMP_SPEED	= How many Pictures per second (0 mean fastest)
DUMP_COUTN	= How many Pictures ( start with programm start ) if activate by GUI count = 100k


DEVICE		= "This is the device /dev/v4l/video1 that is used for input"
V4L_FPS		= "Frames per Second Range: 4-30"
V4L_HEIGHT	= "The captured image heigh"
V4_WIDTH	= "The captured image width"

FONT[1-3]	= "Here can the font of the gui changed (only true type fonts"
DEBUG		= 0 or 1 at the moment for lot of debug (and timming) information.

FILTER_INVERT
FILTER_NOISE	= This values take 0 or 1 if the filter is default activaded
FILTER_RANGE
FILTER_*	= set Mode for filter * (* ist the plugin name) 0=Off 1..N=depending on the module

FTP_HOST	= If ftp upload shall be used then you need to enter this four field's
FTP_USER	 
FTP_PASS
FTP_FILE
FTP_TEMP	= I recomend to use this too, this define an temporary name on the server side.
		  So the during the upload time the target file is not invalid and after completing
		  the Upload temp is renamed to the real file.

FILTER_USER 	=  User definable chaining forumal of filter (under develop)
			"SRC=AND(SRC,A0=TRASH(A0=ABSDIFF(SRC,CAP),20))"

LOGO_PATH       = The path to a logo image to by blitted at LOGO_POS
LOGO_POS        = 0 = Not blitted, 1 = Upper Left, 2 = Upper Right,
		3 = Lower Right, 4 = Lower Left, 5 = Center
