Version 0.4 Changelog

-- 02/12/02 Raphael Assenat
- Also removed sfont, the old interface stuff, and bitmap font files.
- Removed ccvt completely.
- Written an install script. Make install now works, and it is no longer necessary to have
the ressources files in the working directory.
- Ressources files are now located at start, and their location is stored in the
configure structure. had to do small changes to interface.c in the init section to do this.
- Added more command line args to change dump path and dump mode
- Coded a workaround in webcam.c. The webcam driver did not return the correct value
when asked the white balance mode, so the value is now kept locally. This problems may
be specific to kernel 2.4.16, pwcx, and ToUcam-740.
- Added new color convertion code by Thomas Lussing. 75% faster than ccvt!!

The video device used by the program is displayed at startup.
Fixed all compilation warnings :)
Fixed a few mistakes, which prevented the code to compile if MMX was not defined.
Removed #define MMX from SDL_v4l_Filter_thomas.h, so it can be set from the
Makefile using the -DMMX option. 

Integrated Thomas Lussnig MMX filters in the source tree.
Integrated Thomas Lussnig Jpeg and Png file support. Made Jpeg default.
interface_capture is now in capture.c (not in interface.c). capture.c is 
responsible for saving images in different format, by calling the appropriate
functions in dump_thomas or SDL_SaveBMP, and doing the appropriate RGB<>BGR swapping.

--

Added functions to set and get manual white balance values.
Fixed a bug in webcam.c. When an ioctl failed, the program exited right away.
Added Optimised MMX code by Thomas Lussnig in SDL_v4l_filters.c
Added Command line parser in configuration.c (try SDLcam --help)

A structure declared in configuration.h is now globally usable for default
and configuration values. in configuration.c, a function to create a default
setting and another to parse command line args is available. The default
values are now in configuration.c.  The config file parser and finder 
will be in a separate file, for easier parallel devel. config_file.c.

Added a new Makefile (Makefile.bitmap), to build the program with the old interface.

changed unsigned chars with ints in Average...

SDL_v4l_Filter_range optimised
SDL_v4l_Filter_*bit optimised
SDL_v4l_Filter_Average optimised
SDL_v4l_Filter_Invert optimised
SDL_v4l_Filter_BlueBox added

The status of the filters are now holded in a
global structure rather than a bunch of global variables
and a macro TOGGLE_FILTER(FILTER_MEMBER) is now privided
to toggle filters instead of 3 functions to set, get and
toggle. The structure is declared extern in SDL_v4l_Filters.h,
so it can be accessed by any parts of the program which include this file.
