1) Build cert_extract
2) Make a directory 'certtmp'
3) cd 'certtmp'
4) Run ../cert_extract /path/to/netscape/cert7.db
   This will create many files and an index
5) Merge these files into a bundle with:
   ../cert_bundle /path/to/netscape/cert7.db cert.index ../caroot/ca-bundle.crt
6) Merge these files into a KDE config file with:
   ../certkde
7) mv ksslcalist ../
8) Merge in the local certs that we added ourselves with:
   cd ..
   ./mergelocal
9) Do your diffs!  Make sure you commit what you think you are committing.
10) cvs commit




To add local files:
1) Create the .pem file and check it into cvs in kdelibs/kio/kssl/kssl.
2) List the pem file name as a single line in 'localcerts'.
